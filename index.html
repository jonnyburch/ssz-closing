        <h6>Goodbyeeee</h6>

    		<p>After 8 years, 6 print magazines, hundreds of blog posts and a <i>lot</i> of raucous events, we've decided to call it a day for ShellsuitZombie.</p>

    		<p>SSZ started as a blog, hacked together to try to work out how to be a creative graduate. It was a manifesto of sorts, a reaction against the existing creative establishment. Despite the huge numbers graduating from creative courses across the uk and beyond, it felt too difficult to meet likeminded people, share war stories and work together to make a mark.</p>

    		<p>A lot has changed since 2009, and yet not much has changed. It's easier than ever to create something on your own – a website, an app, a book, a brand. Yet the level of support for, and community around young creatives is still not easy to find.</p>

    		<p>We played a small part, maybe. We helped a bunch of people find friends, contacts, even jobs, making the whole thing a bit less scary.</p>

    		<p>But we're old now. The people who joined us in the last few years to help are old, even. It would be hypocritical of us to keep fighting the graduate fight – we're not graduates.</p>

    		<p>So it's with heavy hearts, but tons of great memories, that we're shutting up shop. It's been the best side project ever, and we've got so much out of it.</p>

    		<p>Thanks, everyone who gave up time, money and creative juice. We love you all, and we're available for beers or breakfast any time.</p>

    		<p>To see our open letter to our zombies, go <a href="https://medium.com/@jonnyburch/goodbye-shellsuitzombie-59d68e095078">here</a>. To buy our 6th (and likely final) <a href="http://www.stackmagazines.com/awards/">award-winning</a> issue, go <a href="http://six.shellsuitzombie.co.uk/">here</a>.</p>

    		<p>Peace</p>

              <h3>Issue 6</h3>    
              <p class="blurbtext">Our sixth issue explores what it means to try, succeed, fail, laugh, cry, have an existential crisis or two and then figure out what just happened. We take an honest look at the uncertainty and disillusionment many face in the early stages of a creative career, as well as the learning experiences and self-discovery we go through in pursuit of that ‘dream job.'</p>
              <p class="blurbtext">Articles and interviews include Pentagram partner Naresh Ramchandani, Well Made Studio, Off Life Magazine, Kate Moross and the founders of ShellsuitZombie, alongside original illustrations from the likes of Alex Gamsu Jenkins, Thomas Hedger, Alice Bowsher and many more.</p>

        <h3>Thanks:</h3>
        <p>We have so many people to thank, that it will be impossible to do it here without forgetting someone. But here goes.</p>
        <p>Ellie, James, Rob B, Ross and the original zombies. Alex and Sam for being utter legends and pushing SSZ further than we could have imagined. Jo Church, for helping with Uncontained then forever afterwards. All the second generation zombies - Matt, Christina, Little Stu, Charlotte, Stephanie, Becki, James and Rob, Chris Cryer, Chris Wise, Jake, Jade, Ash, Kd, Emily, Ray, Peter Murgatroyd, Jay, and plenty more.</p>
        <p>Anyone that helped us out from friends, partners and sponsors - especially Laura and Rhiannon at D&AD and Mark and Lucy at 55DSL.</p>
        <p>Those who let themselves be interviewed/assaulted by us, or lent us space/beer/sound systems to assault others.</p>
        <p>And anyone who came along, bought an issue or a poster, hung out with us or egged us on. We've learnt a lot.</p>
        <p>Thanks all.</p>
